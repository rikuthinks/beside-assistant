# Beside AI

Beside AI is an AI-powered executive assistant designed to keep you on track at your own pace.

- Utilizes state of the art prompt engineering and the latest OpenAI completion endpoint to understand user questions and generate natural language responses.
- Utilizes Next.js v13 with the experimental appDirectory feature and TypeScript on the front-end, with Upstash and Redis for serverless back-end functionality.
- Implements OAuth for user authentication and Pusher Channels for real-time messaging.
- Uses SWR for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Styled the application with Tailwind CSS.
- Utilized Framer Motion to create interactive and animated UI components.
- This project allowed me to explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence in web development and gain experience with serverless architecture and real-time communication.
