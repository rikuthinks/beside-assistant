# Beside AI

Beside is an AI-powered Question & Answer agent designed to be your know-it-all partner to ask questions on-the-go.

Need a quick answer to a trivia question about your favorite late artist? Need to convert a measurement and forgot the formula? Beside is with you.

- Utilizes state of the art prompt engineering and the latest OpenAI completion endpoint to understand user questions and generate natural language responses.
- Utilizes Next.js v13 with the experimental appDirectory feature and TypeScript on the front-end, with Upstash and Redis for serverless back-end functionality.
- Implements OAuth for user authentication and Pusher Channels for real-time messaging.
- Uses SWR for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Styled the application with Tailwind CSS.
- Utilized Framer Motion to create interactive and animated UI components.
- This project allowed me to explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence in web development and gain experience with serverless architecture and real-time communication.
